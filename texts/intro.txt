You are Pad, a paddle.

Here you are in your room, bouncing a ball off the wall.

It's the best thing ever! You could do that all day. In fact, you do just that, most days.

You play with your ball in your room, in the kitchen, in the garden, in the outhouse...everywhere.

And why not? Those who are not playing with balls right now clearly don't know what a great time it is.

And from a metaphysical perspective...

Whoopsie, too much thinking distracted you and that window paid the price...

The window be damned, but that was Rolly, your favorite ball! So round and bally...you have to get it back!

But first, take some balls from the basket, they may come in handy...
