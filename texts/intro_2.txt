You are Pad, a paddle.

Here you are in your room, bouncing a ball off the wall.

It's the best thing ever! You could do that all day. In fact, you do just that, most days.

You play with your ball in your room, in the kitchen, in the garden, in the outhouse...everywhere.

And why not? Those who are not playing with balls right now clearly don't know what a great time it is.

And from a metaphysical perspective...

--- window break ---

Whoopsie, too much thinking distracted you and that window paid the price...

The window be damned, but that was Rolly, your favorite ball! So round and bally...you have to get it back!

But first, take some balls from the basket, they may come in handy...

--- kitchen scene ---

D	Pal? You look weird...and why are you carrying those balls? What's going on?

P	Nothing dad, I was just playing with my ball... And it went out through the window, I'll get it.

D	Oh, you should keep that window closed, I told you.

P	Yes, yes, it was closed.

D	But then...?

P	Well, let's say now the window is very much open...

D	What the... you little...!

---

D	You're not going anywhere, young paddle!

D	No ball playing for a month, you hear me? You'll sit and play videogames as a punishment! Not a single bounce for you!


D	Oh no, uncle Austin's bookshelf! He had the books ordered by number of words in each! How am I supposed to recreate that?!

D	That Chinese vase! Destruction be thy name!

D	Awesome. Now we have a window in that painting too! A replacement for the window you broke, huh?


D	I knew it! I should have just gotten a pet elephant instead, would have been less damage! But no, your mother wanted a child...!
